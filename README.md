# LIMA: Lipid Mediator Analyst Application 

# Overview
This repository contains the code and required files to run the LIMA app locally using RStudio. The LIMA application is a user-friendly application to process and analyse lipid mediator profiling LC-MS data. The application built automatizes the calculation of lipid mediator concentrations and allow the analyses of the data by statistics, machine learning, and pathway analysis. This tool grants biologists and researchers an efficient manner to analyse lipid mediator data which can be used to make biological findings including identifying biomarkers and new therapeutic agonists for diseases
